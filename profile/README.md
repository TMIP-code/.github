# TMIP

*The Transport Matrix Intercomparison Project*

---

This TMIP-code GitHub organisation is intended to be the home for TMIP-related code.
The goal is for researchers to build and compare transport matrices extracted from [CMIP](https://wcrp-cmip.org/) model output.
The hope is that sharing the code publicly will foster collaboration and lead to research papers that advance our scientific knowledge.

Note that this project is work in progress and in an early stage, so expect unfinished jobs and lots of changes.
